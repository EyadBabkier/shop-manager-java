# 🛒 JavaFX Product Manager

This is a desktop application developed using **JavaFX** that simulates a basic product management system. The application allows users to **add**, **search**, and **delete** products through a simple graphical interface.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project is **not intended for real-world shop management**. It was built as part of a university assignment to demonstrate GUI development, input validation, and event-driven programming in JavaFX. It's a skill development exercise, not a production-ready system.
